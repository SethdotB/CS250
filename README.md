# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Getting the user needs really means to understand what they want to achieve and creating solutions for those needs. It is important to communicate with the stakeholders/users to gather these requirements. The creation of user stories helps with this process by organizing the needs into a clear and concise structure from a useful perspective. The user stories can then help with creating specific test cases that can be used to gather usable feedback.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
An iterative approach will always be beneficial as it allows the best method of productivity in my eyes. I am able to break down the project and work on things that I know can be built out while working up towards things that will need to be tested more often. Always doing short sprints with daily stand up meetings should continue to help with my development and creating the best software I can. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Continuous work on the technical side of things while also developing in communcation, collaboration, and keeping a posistive attitude is what makes a great team member. These should ensure that each individual has a sense of responsibility and is able to stay adaptable in most project scenarios.
